## Hi:wave:, I'm Jack

I'm an **Information Analyst** at [Enexis](https://www.enexisgroep.com/about/company-profile/), one of the largest (energy) Grid operator's in the Netherlands servicing around 3 million households and businesses. When I'm not analysing processes and information I also like to build stuff:wrench:. Coding, web development and design have always been a hobby I'm passionate about and now I'm practicing to become a Full stack developer in my free time.

If you're still reading, I would like to introduce you to [The Player of Games](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630.The_Player_of_Games) by Ian M. banks, a novel in his [Culture series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49118-culture). One of the best Sci-Fi:rocket: series I've ever read. On that note, if you're really into Sci-Fi and anime you should definitely watch [Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13963530/).
